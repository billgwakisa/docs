## What it is

Launch wallets and lending in your app while the FSP remains custodian. Credit scoring plugs into lending decisions. Journals and reports support reconciliation.

## Capabilities

- Wallets: open wallet, balance, statements, top‑up, payout
- Lending: apply, approve, disburse, schedule, repay, reschedule
- Credit Scoring: retrieve and refresh scores
- Reporting: GL/journal exports, portfolio and settlement summaries

<Note>
Ledgers live at the FSP; Bridge stores mapping IDs and audit logs. All PII stays in KYC; services use `customerId`.
</Note>
